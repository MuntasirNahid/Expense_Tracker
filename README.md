## 🧠 Learnings & Motivation
This project was built as a part of my React Native learning journey. After transitioning from Flutter, I wanted to create something practical from scratch to strengthen my skills. Working on this app helped me understand key concepts like navigation, modals, state management, reusable components, and SQLite integration in a real-world context.
